## About
Hi, I'm Gladwell ! I have an analytical background in Data Management  and I have  completed my Diploma in Information Communication Technology ( Information Systems ) . I have developed a strong foundation in the Application Development  and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data Analysis as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

I like exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
